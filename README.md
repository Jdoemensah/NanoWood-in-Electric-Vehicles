# Forecasting Carbon Benefits/Demand for Wood Nanomaterials in Electric Vehicles 
Forecasts demand and carbon benefits of wood-based nano materials as bio fillers in automotive composite applications 

# Background
Wood-based nanomaterials have gained considerable attention as promising alternatives to pretroluem-derived products in automotive applications. Wood-based nanomaterials are abundant, readily avaibale and have high strength properties as bio-based fillers in automotive composites. Adoption of new materials and technology in the automotive industry is challenging. While techincal factors such as product property, potential demand and profitability are important for adoptability of technology, information on product sustainability and environmental stewardship is important. In this analysis, current vehicle use and emissions data is used to forcaste the carbon benefits and demand of wood-based nanomaterials as sustainable alternatives in automobile application.
